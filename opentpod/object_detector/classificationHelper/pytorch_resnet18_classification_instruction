Instruction for Pytorch ResNet18 Usage:
1. Do usual labeling work on TPOD
2. Select "Detector Types" as "Pytorch Classification ResNet18"
3. Select videos to train models (only videos can be used to train)
4. Choose suitable epoch number. The default number is 25. 
5. Start to train. 
6. Till the training finishing, download the trained model. 

Optional:
7. Set the model directory path and the image containing the classifying item in pytorch_classification_infer.py (Note: only the directory path is needed)
8. Run the pytorch_classfication_infer.py, and the name of the classified item would be printed. 

The parameters setted in OpenTPOD:
Batch size = 4
num worker = 4
learning rate = 0.001
momentum = 0.9
# Decay learning rate by a factor of 0.1 every 7 epochs
factor = 0.1
epoch number = 7
